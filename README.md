## Project statement
The goal of this lab is to reinforce the concepts learned about vulnerability numbering and scoring when studying CVE and CVSS.

### Activity 1
Consider two vulnerabilities with the following vectors:
1. `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`
2. `CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N`

Discuss which one is riskier and why. Provide sound arguments supporting your choice.

### Activity 2
Use [cvedetails.com](https://cvedetails.com) to browse through SQL injection vulnerabilities (select `Vulnerabilities by type`) for different years.
1. What is the most common CVSS score for this type of vulnerability? What is the reason?
2. Find two SQL injection vulnerabilities with a CVSS score different from the most common (one higher and one lower) and explain why the score is different in these cases.
